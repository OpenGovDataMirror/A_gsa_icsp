<p>Mitigating re-identification risk and the protection of data: Public trust in the statistical system is central to the system's success. Without the voluntary participation of survey respondents and the reliable compliance of individuals and businesses in completing required data forms, the statistical system would be severely hampered and our statistics open to dispute. ICSP is taking a leading role in exploring ways to protect respondent data from unauthorized identification by any number of means, including direct data breaches and matching of multiple datasets. In addition, ICSP has tasked the FCSM with updating existing data protection protocols and expanding upon a toolkit for agencies to use to support their data protection activities.</p>
