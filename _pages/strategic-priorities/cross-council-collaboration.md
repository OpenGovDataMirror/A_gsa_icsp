<p>While the ICSP pre-dates the Evidence Act, not so the Chief Data Officers Council (CDOC) and the Chief Evaluation Officers Council (EOC). These new entities execute key elements of the Act's mission, and each has done a brilliant job of launching their own projects and missions. Cooperation between the three councils is crucial to attaining the vision of the Act: that policies would one day be based, where possible, on evidence developed according to scientific standards and through widely transparent processes. ICSP will find as many ways as possible to support the CDOC and EOC and to advance those projects that overlap with the mission and projects of ICSP.</p>
