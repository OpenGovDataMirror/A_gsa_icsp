<p>The Evidence Act identified the importance of expanding access to CIPSEA-covered data for policymaking decisions, while at the same time ensuring the privacy of data providers and the confidentiality of their data. To address this dual mandate, the Evidence Act tasks CIPSEA agencies with conducting comprehensive risk assessments of their data to determine sensitivity levels and corresponding levels of access. This concept of "tiered access," is to be based on standards to be issued by OMB.</p>

<p>One of the ways in which Title III regulations are implemented is through the Standard Application Process technical subcommittee, which develops technical specifications to guide the development of the next phases of a Common Application Form and associated process, leveraging subject matter expertise from participating CIPSEA and other interested agencies, to meet the requirements of the Foundations for Evidence-Based Policy-Making Act of 2018.</p>
